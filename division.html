            <h1>INDIA</h1>
            <p>India, officially the Republic of India (Hindi: Bhārat Gaṇarājya), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country, and the most populous democracy in the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[f] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand, Myanmar and Indonesia.</p>

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or Homo sapiens, had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had earlier evolved. The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago. After 6500 BCE, evidence for domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in what is now Balochistan, Pakistan.[76] These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation,[77][76] the first urban culture in South Asia,[78] which flourished during 2500–1900 BCE in what is now Pakistan and western India.[79] Centred around cities such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and Kalibangan, and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade.[78]
            During the period 2000–500 BCE, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic cultures to the Iron Age ones.[80] The Vedas, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism,[81] were composed during this period,[82] and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain.[80] Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan migration into the subcontinent from the north-west.[81] The caste system, which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by labelling their occupations impure, arose during this period.[83] On the Deccan Plateau, archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation.[80] In South India, a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from this period,[84] as well as by nearby traces of agriculture, irrigation tanks, and craft traditions.[84]</p>

            <h3>Medieval India</h3>    
            <p>The Indian early medieval age, from 600 to 1200 CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity.[103] When Harsha of Kannauj, who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647 CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan.[104] When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the Pala king of Bengal.[104] When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the Pallavas from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south.[104] No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond their core region.[103] During this time, pastoral peoples, whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy, were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes.[105] The caste system consequently began to show regional differences.[105]</p>
            <p>In the 6th and 7th centuries, the first devotional hymns were created in the Tamil language.[106] They were imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all modern languages of the subcontinent.[106] Indian royalty, big and small, and the temples they patronised drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became economic hubs as well.[107] Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation.[107] By the 8th and 9th centuries, the effects were felt in South-East Asia, as South Indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-day Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, and Java.[108] Indian merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission; South-East Asians took the initiative as well, with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages.[108]</p>

            <h3>Early modern India</h3>
            <p>In the early 16th century, northern India, then under mainly Muslim rulers,[116] fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors.[117] The resulting Mughal Empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule. Instead, it balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices[118][119] and diverse and inclusive ruling elites,[120] leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule.[121] Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially under Akbar, the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine status.[120] The Mughal state's economic policies, deriving most revenues from agriculture[122] and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency,[123] caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets.[121] The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India's economic expansion,[121] resulting in greater patronage of painting, literary forms, textiles, and architecture.[124] Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India, such as the Marathas, the Rajputs, and the Sikhs, gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military experience.[125] Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India.[125] As the empire disintegrated, many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs.[126]</p>
            <p>By the early 18th century, with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred, a number of European trading companies, including the English East India Company, had established coastal outposts.[127][128] The East India Company's control of the seas, greater resources, and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly assert its military strength and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the Indian elite; these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over the Bengal region by 1765 and sideline the other European companies.[129][127][130][131] Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annexe or subdue most of India by the 1820s.[132] India was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had, but was instead supplying the British Empire with raw materials. Many historians consider this to be the onset of India's colonial period.[127] By this time, with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and having effectively been made an arm of British administration, the company began more consciously to enter non-economic arenas like education, social reform, and culture.[133]</p>
